Hi, I am Subodh Kathayat, a social activist and a technopreneur. With a
strong interest in technology, I want to help this society by sharing my
knowledge. In my spare time, you can find me sitting in nature, drinking
coffee, and reading Ben Casnocha Books. (Best combination)
This is how I want to live my adventurous life.
